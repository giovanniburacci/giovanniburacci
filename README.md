## Hi visitor :smiley:	

This is my GitHub Repo.
Here, you will find some snippets of the personal projects I'm working on.

### Who am I? :man_shrugging:	

Even though the answer is not even completely clear to me, I'm a **BSc computer engineering student** @Politecnico di Milano (Italy).
I've started coding when I was 8 years old, approaching VB.Net through online videos and even a book that my father gifted me.
I recently switched from a software engineer role (frontend development) to a data engineer position. I am currently working on perfecting my Python and data skills.
