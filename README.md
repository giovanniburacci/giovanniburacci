## Hi visitor :smiley:

Here, you will find some snippets of the personal projects I'm working on.

### Who am I? :man_shrugging:	

Even though the answer is not even completely clear to me, I'm a **BSc computer engineering student** @Politecnico di Milano (Italy).
I've started coding when I was 8 years old, approaching VB.Net through online videos and even a book that my father gifted me.
ATM I'm more involved into *web developing* (JS, TS, React, Angular and so on), but keep in my mind that my dreams and interests are not limited to what I'm doing right now... **so who knows what you'll se here** :sweat_smile:
